                    <h4 className="story-subheading">The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>
                        Alex loves gardening and has discovered a magical plant. The plant grows differently based on how much sunlight and water it gets. Alex wants to figure out the best combination to make it grow the tallest—but there are too many possibilities to try manually.
                        To solve this, Alex decides to learn about Machine Learning (ML), a method to teach computers to analyze data and make predictions!
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="story-subheading">What is Machine Learning?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Machine Learning (ML) helps computers find patterns in data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.
                        <b>Example:</b> Instead of manually testing every combination of sunlight and water, Alex can collect data, use ML to find patterns, and predict the best conditions for the plant to grow.
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="story-subheading">Let’s Explore Data!</h4>
                    <p>
                        On the right, you see a scatter plot. Each dot represents an experiment Alex has conducted, and the axes show its features like sunlight and water.
                        <b>Your Task:</b>
                        Adjust the axes to explore how features are related to plant growth:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>X-axis:</b> Sunlight, Water.</li>
                            <li><b>Y-axis:</b> Growth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Use filters to focus on specific groups of data:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Show experiments with sunlight &gt; 6 hours.</li>
                            <li>Highlight experiments with water &gt; 3 liters.</li>
                            <li>Filter experiments where the plant grew taller than 50 cm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="story-subheading">The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>
                        Can you help Alex find the best conditions for the magical plant to grow the tallest?
                        <b>Instruction:</b>
                        Use the controls on the right-hand side to adjust the scatter plot.
                        Identify the combination of sunlight and water that led to the tallest plants.
                        Once you’re done, click 'Submit' to check your findings!
